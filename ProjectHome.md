## John A. Nairn Research Software ##
This project contains source code for the computation mechanics software originating from <a href='http://www.cof.orst.edu/cof/wse/faculty/Nairn'>John A. Nairn's research group</a> at <a href='http://oregonstate.edu/'>Oregon State University</a>.

## Computational Mechanics Code Engines ##

The code engines `NairnFEA` and `NairnMPM` do finite element analysis (FEA) and material point method (MPM) calculations. They are platform-independent `C++` code projects. The FEA engine is static, linear elastic, and 2D. The MPM engine is 2D or 3D, is dynamic, and can handle any defined material types.

## MacOS X Complete Package - **NairnFEAMPM** ##

If you are working on a Mac computer, you can download the <a href='http://osupdocs.forestry.oregonstate.edu/index.php/NairnFEAMPM'><b>NairnFEAMPM</b></a>.application. This application lets you edit command files for input to code engines, run calculations, and visualize the results. It also contains precompiled binaries allowing to run calculations without downloading and compiling this project. The Mac application is also available as a free download from the <a href='http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=496317896&mt=12'>Mac App store</a>. To work with source code (instead of the included binaries) when using **NairnFEAMPM**, see its help information on "Code Engine Development."

If you are not working on a Mac, another component of this project is the Java application called **NairnFEAMPMViz**. This application can edit command files for input to the code engines, run calculations, and visualize and display the results. It will run on any platform (although **NairnFEAMPM** is still preferred when working on a Mac because it has more features and better graphics).

## Documentation Files ##

Documentation for downloading, installing, and using this software is provided  on the <a href='http://osupdocs.forestry.oregonstate.edu/index.php/Main_Page'>OSUPDocs Wiki</a>. The downloaded project also has brief documentation.
